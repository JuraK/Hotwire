# Hotwire
Hotwire anemometry data processing from Dantec StreamWare

This Python script can process raw data measured by a hot-wire anemometer. Current implementation is ready for dealing with a text file exported from Dantec software - StreamWare. So far it can deal with one and two wire probe.

Purpose of the work is to get hands on the data processing and bring some light into the black box such as StreamWare software. It also overcomes some difficulties with temperature correction when using MiniCTA.
